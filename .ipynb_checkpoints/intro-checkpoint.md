# Understanding Negative Binomial Distribution versus Geometric Distribution

Statistics, and statistical modeling, provide a broad variety of mathematical tools for both understanding our world and, more importantly, creating predictive models. There can be some difficulty, however, in understanding which predictive model to choose.  One specific scenario is deciding whether to use **Negative Binomial Distribution** versus **Geometric distribution**.

# Negative Binomial Distribution versus Geometric Distribution
## How Are The Similar

**Negative Binomial Distribution** distributions and **Geometric distribution** are similar in structure: each describe a series of independent trials with exactly two possible outcomes.  These outcomes are typically described in terms of success/failure.  For example, geneticist often describe simple heredity (binary) as a phenotype that either is expressed or not expressed.  Other examples include models describing pass or fail (as in I'm either going to pass my Tools of the Data Scientist course or fail..haha.)

Try this for yourself...

:::{admonition} Who will win the Superbowl?
:class: tip, dropdown
No, this can have multiple outcomes (nonbinary results).
:::



:::{admonition} Will win the Seattle Seahawks win the Superbowl?
:class: tip, dropdown
Yes, this has exactly two possible outcomes (binary results).
:::



:::{admonition} Choose a digit (between 0 and 9)?
:class: tip, dropdown
No, this can have multiple outcomes (nonbinary (10 possible) results).
:::



:::{admonition} Is a randomly chosen digit greater than 3?
:class: tip, dropdown
Yes, this has exactly two possible outcomes (binary results).
:::


Now that we understand the binary nature, we can examine how these are used in [](section-label) distributions and Geometric distributions.
